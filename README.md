# folder_to_bw
Change an entire folder of images to black and white

...
CHANGE THE PATH OF THE FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE!!!
...

To get the right path, navigate to the folder you want to turn black and white, and copy the path. Then, in the code, paste that path at the top of the code (there should be a commented block highlighting where). Change any backslashes to forward slashes so the path looks like this:

path = "D:/Pictures/Folder"

Instead of this:

path = "D:\Pictures\Folder"
